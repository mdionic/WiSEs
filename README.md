# Water in Salts (WiSEs)
These files are polarizable force field parameter files and simulation scripts for simulating high-concentration (13 m-21 m) LiTFSI aqueous solutions. These polarizable force filed are based on the CL&Pol. It works well with the MD engine OpenMM (version 7.5.0). The simulations need to utilize the [openmm-velocityVerlet plugin including package ommhelper](https://github.com/z-gong/openmm-velocityVerlet?tab=readme-ov-file).
